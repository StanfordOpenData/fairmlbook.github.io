<p>Our success, happiness, and wellbeing are never fully of our own making. Others’ decisions can profoundly affect the course of our lives: whether to admit us to a particular school, offer us a job, or grant us a mortgage. Arbitrary, inconsistent, or faulty decision-making thus raises serious concerns because it risks limiting our ability to achieve the goals that we have set for ourselves and access the opportunities for which we are qualified.</p>
<p>So how do we ensure that these decisions are made the right way and for the right reasons? While there’s much to value in fixed rules, applied consistently, <em>good</em> decisions take available evidence into account. We expect admissions, employment, and lending decisions to rest on factors that are relevant to the outcome of interest.</p>
<p>Identifying details that are relevant to a decision might happen informally and without much thought: employers might observe that people who study math seem to perform particularly well in the financial industry. But they could test these observations against historical evidence by examining the degree to which one’s major correlates with success on the job. This is the traditional work of statistics—and it promises to provide a more reliable basis for decision-making by quantifying how much weight to assign certain details in our determinations.</p>
<p>Decades of research have compared the accuracy of statistical models to the judgments of humans, even experts with years of experience, and found that in many situations data-driven decisions trounce those based on intuition or expertise.<span><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">R.M. Dawes, D. Faust, and P.E. Meehl, “Clinical Versus Actuarial Judgment,” <em>Science</em> 243, no. 4899 (1989): 1668–74.</span></span> These results have been welcomed as a way to ensure that the high-stakes decisions that shape our life chances are both accurate and fair.</p>
<p>Machine learning promises to bring greater discipline to decision-making because it offers to uncover factors that are relevant to decision-making that humans might overlook, given the complexity or subtlety of the relationships in historical evidence. Rather than starting with some intuition about the relationship between certain factors and an outcome of interest, machine learning lets us defer the question of relevance to the data themselves: which factors—among all that we have observed—bear a statistical relationship to the outcome.</p>
<p>Uncovering patterns in historical evidence can be even more powerful than this might seem to suggest. Recent breakthroughs in computer vision—specifically object recognition—reveal just how much pattern-discovery can achieve. In this domain, machine learning has helped to overcome a strange fact of human cognition: while we may be able to effortlessly identify objects in a scene, we are unable to specify the full set of rules that we rely upon to make these determinations. We cannot hand code a program that exhaustively enumerates all the relevant factors that allow us to recognize objects from every possible perspective or in all their potential visual configurations. Machine learning aims to solve this problem by abandoning the attempt to teach a computer through explicit instruction in favor of a process of learning by example. By exposing the computer to many examples of images containing pre-identified objects, we hope the computer will learn the patterns that reliably distinguish different objects from one another and from the environments in which they appear.</p>
<p>This can feel like a remarkable achievement, not only because computers can now execute complex tasks but also because the rules for deciding what appears in an image seem to emerge from the data themselves.</p>
<p>But there are serious risks in learning from examples. Learning is not a process of simply committing examples to memory. Instead, it involves generalizing from examples: honing in on those details that are characteristic of (say) cats in general, not just the specific cats that happen to appear in the examples. This is the process of induction: drawing general rules from specific examples—rules that effectively account for past cases, but also apply to future, as yet unseen cases, too. The hope is that we’ll figure out how future cases are likely to be similar to past cases, even if they are not exactly the same.</p>
<p>This means that reliably generalizing from historical examples to future cases requires that we provide the computer with <em>good</em> examples: a sufficiently large number of examples to uncover subtle patterns; a sufficiently diverse set of examples to showcase the many different types of appearances that objects might take; a sufficiently well-annotated set of examples to furnish machine learning with reliable ground truth; and so on. Thus, evidence-based decision-making is only as reliable as the evidence on which it is based, and high quality examples are critically important to machine learning. The fact that machine learning is “evidence-based” by no means ensures that it will lead to accurate, reliable, or fair decisions.</p>
<p>This is especially true when using machine learning to model human behavior and characteristics. Our historical examples of the relevant outcomes will almost always reflect historical prejudices against certain social groups, prevailing cultural stereotypes, and existing demographic inequalities. And finding patterns in these data will often mean replicating these very same dynamics.</p>
<p>We write this book as machine learning begins to play a role in especially consequential decision-making. In the criminal justice system, defendants are assigned statistical scores that are intended to predict the risk of committing future crimes, and these scores inform decisions about bail, sentencing, and parole. In the commercial sphere, firms use machine learning to analyze and filter resumes of job applicants. And statistical methods are of course the bread and butter of lending, credit, and insurance underwriting.</p>
<p>At the same time, machine learning powers everyday applications that might seem frivolous in comparison but collectively have a powerful effect on shaping our culture: search engines, news recommenders, and ad targeting algorithms influence our information diet and our worldviews; chatbots and social recommendation engines mediate our interactions with the world.</p>
<p>This book is an attempt to survey the risks in these and many other applications of machine learning, and to provide a critical review of an emerging set of proposed solutions. It will show how even well-intentioned applications of machine learning might give rise to objectionable results. And it will introduce formal methods for characterizing these problems and assess various computational methods for addressing them.</p>

<h1>Community Impact</h1>
<p>This section discusses some strategies to identify the community impact, both the benefits and risks, of an open data portal.</p>
<p>We have found that many universities&rsquo; data ecosystems are complicated to navigate &mdash; datasets are hard to find and there is a lack of knowledge as to which datasets even exist. In addition, most of these datasets only exist in a PDF format, which disincentivizes and, to some extent, prevents curious community members from analyzing or visualizing the data. For example, every year US universities publish a Common Dataset in line with federal law with data on enrollment, student characteristics, finances, and more. The yearly nature of this data makes it prime for historical analysis &mdash; but the fact that the data is in PDF format and isn&rsquo;t connected to previous years makes it difficult for community members to embark on an analysis.</p>
<p>Here are several key stakeholders who would benefit from easier access to university data:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Students: Open data can aid journalistic efforts; improve understanding of the community; and fuel projects for journalists, civic-minded students, student-body leaders, student groups, and more.</li>
<ul>
<li>At Northwestern University, a group of students used datasets on Northwestern University Police field stops, case distribution, and traffic stops found on the Northwestern Open Data Initiative to <a href="https://medium.com/@rshuks/a-data-driven-investigation-into-the-northwestern-police-department-62eeaa9efe3a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document</a> anti-Blackness in the Northwestern University Police Department.</li>
</ul>
<li>Faculty, Staff, and Researchers: Open data can help with targeted campus improvements and aid ongoing projects.</li>
<ul>
<li>The Stanford Open Data Portal assembled and hosted a regularly updated COVID-19 dataset with case counts, deaths, and other relevant statistics from 12 Bay Area counties. The dataset was used by researchers throughout the Bay Area who were analyzing the virus&rsquo;s spread.</li>
</ul>
<li>Classes and Clubs: Open data can be integrated into design, engineering, and analytics classes/clubs to promote data literacy among the student body.</li>
<ul>
<li>The Stanford Open Data Portal worked with the student government and campus newspaper to administer the Stanford Community Survey, which included questions related to socioeconomic status. It is in the process of being opened.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>When used appropriately, open data can help empower members of marginalized communities, providing more tools to demonstrate how campus organizations directly or indirectly harm marginalized communities. To do this successfully, it is important to include a broad and diverse set of communities in the need-finding and data governance processes to make better decisions about which datasets to prioritize acquiring, as well as how to work with the data. Additionally, proactive attention on empowering marginalized communities will help you identify datasets that <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> exist, and set you up to work with the relevant entities to locate, obtain, or create these datasets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, in building the product, identify a targeted set of potential users. Ideally, they will be invested in the final product and can contribute to the development of ideas, user feedback, and testing. When building a community-facing product, it is important to involve potential users in the development process.</p>
<p>Open data can be powerful, but it also comes with risks. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15hiM6Hl8I116pgg1Qw7fmKQk4qTE0rwsfh7ikzxC07c/edit#bookmark=id.3qwtzof4lmab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Governance</a> section for a comprehensive breakdown of challenges and how to mitigate them.</p>

<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
<p>Having an organizational mission statement is useful to align high-level goals, promote an organizational culture, and portray external legitimacy. Here are some goals to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transparency:</span> University operations should be broadly accessible for the campus community it serves.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Engagement:</span> Members of the campus should be empowered with information to be involved in the broader campus community.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Accountability:</span> Open data can ensure accountability from universities to act in the best interests of their community members.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Build:</span> Open data organizations provide valuable experience to their members in building useful public-facing tools.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Educate:</span> Open data organizations can benefit their members and the broader community <span style="font-style: italic;">educationally</span> by increasing data-related skillsets and awareness for builders and the broader community.</li>
</ol>
  </section>
<section id="the-state-of-society" class="level1">
<h1>Team</h1>
<p>Given the understanding that finding <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> peers with the time and motivation to take on a new project is a difficult task, here are some rough guidelines on expertise and considerations that we found useful. We expect individuals to fill multiple roles at the start of the project.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important skills to seek out:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Product:</span> Motivated by understanding the community&rsquo;s open data needs, creating the vision, and shaping the team&rsquo;s work to align with these high-level goals.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Backend:</span> Building out the infrastructure for hosting and managing data is essential for success.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Frontend:</span> The representation of data on your portal is the difference between &ldquo;open data&rdquo; and &ldquo;available data.&rdquo;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outreach:</span> A technical platform is useless without the data to showcase. Work within members of your community to gain access to that data, and maintain those relationships.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Governance:</span> It is important to understand the data landscape and foster relationships with key members in the university&rsquo;s data governance structure.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">User Experience:</span> A major downfall for many existing data portals is the complexity in their interfaces. Working with users and catering the experience to real applications of your platform allows your data to become accessible.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Journalism / Data Visualization:</span> Beyond the data itself, analysis is a strong component of your platform. Keeping these users in mind will continue to advise your structural decisions.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Operations:</span> As you expand your team, keeping track of all of the moving parts will become increasingly difficult. It&rsquo;s worth having someone to help manage these growing pains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, remember that you&rsquo;re working with data, organizations, and people that represent a diverse set of backgrounds. Building a team that represents the diversity of the student body (e.g. by race, gender, socioeconomic status, etc.) isn&rsquo;t just the right thing to do, but it also provides you with valuable perspectives from different parts of campus.&nbsp;</p></section>
<section id="the-trouble-with-measurement" class="level1">
<h1>Motivating the Team</h1>
<p>Building a passionate, sustainable team isn&rsquo;t easy&mdash;think about how you&rsquo;ll keep everyone excited and engaged for the long haul. You may be motivated by the mission of opening data at your university, a desire to build a widely used product, or learning skills. Of course, many teammates will be encouraged, at least in part, by external motivators. These may include grades, academic credit, recognition, and resume items&mdash;and they&rsquo;re all valid reasons for undertaking a new endeavor in college.</p>
<p>If you have students motivated by grades and academic credit, consider seeking to complete the project as part of an &ldquo;independent study.&rdquo; For students motivated by recognition and resume items, consider applying for an incubator program. Additionally, titles like &ldquo;Head of Product&rdquo; cost nothing to dole out and are perfect for a resume!</p>
<p>Finally, these incentives often have the added benefit of imposing deadlines for the team. As a result, this provides another valuable motivation to help bring the project to fruition.&nbsp;</p></section>
<section id="from-data-to-models" class="level1">
<h1>Lessons From Other Initiatives</h1>
<p>The data ecosystem at your university can be complex. You should learn how faculty and student groups like your school newspaper currently access, store, and analyze data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to understanding the landscape at your own school, utilize what has already been done in order to showcase the capabilities of university open data portals (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15hiM6Hl8I116pgg1Qw7fmKQk4qTE0rwsfh7ikzxC07c/edit#heading=h.a7upes870117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see case studies</a>). Not only will this go a long way to show the feasibility of your project, but it will also aid in demonstrating the positive impact an open data portal has brought in other university settings.</p></section>
<section id="the-pitfalls-of-action" class="level1">
<h1>The pitfalls of action</h1>
<p>Any real machine-learning system seeks to make some change in the world. To understand its effects, then, we have to consider it in the context of the larger socio-technical system in which it is embedded.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, we’ll see that if a model is calibrated—it faithfully captures the patterns in the underlying data—predictions made using that model will inevitably have disparate error rates for different groups, if those groups have different <em>base rates</em>, that is, rates of positive or negative outcomes. In other words, understanding the properties of a prediction requires understanding not just the model, but also the population differences between the groups on which the predictions are applied.</p>
<p>Further, population characteristics can shift over time; this is a well-known machine learning phenomenon known as drift. If sub-populations change differently over time, that can introduce disparities. An additional wrinkle: whether or not disparities are objectionable may differ between cultures, and may change over time as social norms evolve.</p>
<p>When people are subject to automated decisions, their perception of those decisions depends not only on the outcomes but also the process of decision-making. An ethical decision-making process might require, among other things, the ability to explain a prediction or decision, which might not be feasible with black-box models.</p>
<p>A major limitation of machine learning is that it only reveals correlations, but we often use its predictions as if they reveal causation. This is a persistent source of problems. For example, an early machine learning system in healthcare famously learned the seemingly nonsensical rule that patients with asthma had lower risk of developing pneumonia. This was a true pattern in the data, but the likely reason was that asthmatic patients were more likely to receive in-patient care.<span><label for="sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-25" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">R. Caruana, Y. Lou, J. Gehrke, P. Koch, M. Sturm, and N. Elhadad, “Intelligible Models for Healthcare: Predicting Pneumonia Risk and Hospital 30-Day Readmission,” in <em>Proc. <span class="math inline">21</span>st ACM SIGKDD</em>, 2015, 1721–30.</span></span> So it’s not valid to use the prediction to decide whether or not to admit a patient. We’ll discuss causality in Chapter 4.</p>
<p>Another way to view this example is that the prediction affects the outcome (because of the actions taken on the basis of the prediction), and thus invalidates itself. The same principle is also seen in the use of machine learning for predicting traffic congestion: if sufficiently many people choose their routes based on the prediction, then the route predicted to be clear will in fact be congested. The effect can also work in the opposite direction: the prediction might reinforce the outcome, resulting in feedback loops. To better understand how, let’s talk about the final stage in our loop: feedback.</p>
</section>
<section id="feedback-and-feedback-loops" class="level1">
<h1>Finding a Faculty Advisor</h1>
<p>Any project with faculty endorsement gains instant credibility with the administration that you will inevitably be in contact with. The more time you put into choosing the right faculty member and facilitating your relationship with them, the better you can leverage that relationship into propelling your project forward.</p>
<p>The right faculty member should have a background in technology and advocate for public interest in technology. Beyond interest and experience, your faculty advisor&rsquo;s greatest asset will be their administrative network. Make sure that they at least have the time to make the right introductions for you and your team. Moreover, being able to <span style="font-style: italic;">show</span> your ability and drive to see this project through is an important factor in your ability to mobilize your faculty advisor.</p></section>
<section id="getting-concrete-with-a-toy-example" class="level1">
<h1>Key Data Sources</h1>
<p>An open data portal relies on aggregating large quantities of existing data that community members find useful. Obtaining such data requires partnerships with data stewards or owners on a university campus. It is important to identify and reach out to such stakeholders early in order to ensure wide usage of your portal. Examples of typical stakeholders include the institutional research office, campus newspaper, police department, office of alcohol policy, registrar&rsquo;s office, public health department, student government, campus housing, athletic department, admissions office, campus organizations, IT office, libraries, and data governance office.</p>
<p>To successfully collect datasets, you should be prepared to answer questions about your data portal such as use cases, risk mitigation, and data governance. Your level of data access can vary depending on the source; some may already have infrastructure in place to access their data while others may need you to aggregate the data on your own.&nbsp;</p></section>
<section id="other-ethical-considerations" class="level1">
<h1>Slide Deck</h1>
<p>Prepare a slide deck that explains the aspects of your vision discussed in this section. Remember your target audience, which can include administration, other data partners, funding sources, and new recruits. As such, it would help to have either modular slide decks or multiple versions.</p>
